  "description": "Every 1,000 years, 100 mamodo children are sent to Earth to compete in a battle to become King of the Mamodo World. Each mamodo is paired with a human partner who is given a spell book of a specific color. The human can then use the book to draw out the mamodo's latent powers. If a mamodo's book is burned, they disappear and return to the Mamodo World, relinquishing all right to the title of King. The last mamodo remaining will claim the crown. The series is oriented around Zatch Bell and his human partner, Kiyo Takamine.",
